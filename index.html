                The primary academic field examining education is known as education studies. It delves into the nature
                of education, its objectives, impacts, and methods for enhancement. Education studies encompasses
                various subfields, including philosophy, psychology, sociology, and economics of education.
                Additionally, it explores topics such as comparative education, pedagogy, and the history of education.

                In prehistory, education primarily occurred informally through oral communication and imitation. With
                the emergence of ancient civilizations, the invention of writing led to an expansion of knowledge,
                prompting a transition from informal to formal education. Initially, formal education was largely
                accessible to elites and religious groups. The advent of the printing press in the 15th century
                facilitated widespread access to books, thus increasing general literacy. In the 18th and 19th
                centuries, public education gained significance, paving the way for the global movement to provide
                primary education to all, free of charge, and compulsory up to a certain age. Presently, over 90% of
                primary-school-age children worldwide attend primary school.

                Various scholars emphasize the importance of critical thinking in distinguishing education from
                indoctrination.[17] They argue that indoctrination focuses solely on instilling beliefs in students,
                regardless of their rationality;[18] whereas education also encourages the rational ability to
                critically examine and question those beliefs.[19] However, it is not universally accepted that these
                two phenomena can be clearly distinguished, as some forms of indoctrination may be necessary in the
                early stages of education when the child's mind is not yet fully developed. This is particularly
                relevant in cases where young children must learn certain things without comprehending the underlying
                reasons, such as specific safety rules and hygiene practices.
